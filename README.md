In this project, I've challenged myself to clone the layout of the popular news website Newsweek using React.js and without using any CSS frameworks. My goal was to create a fully responsive website that looks great on devices as small as 320px. In addition to replicating the
site I also changed some of the layout and styling to improve the user experience.

Layout: I have replicated the navigation bar, article styling, article layout, and the footer of the Newsweek website. By cloning the layout, I aim to showcase my attention to detail and proficiency with front-end web development.

Tech stack: I'm using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.

Instructions: To run the project locally, clone the GitHub repository and run 'npm install' in your terminal to install neccesary dependencies. After that you can type 'npm run start' to run the project locally. This project runs locally at the default port 3000.
